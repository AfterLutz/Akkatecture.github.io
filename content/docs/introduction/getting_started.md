### Welcome to Akkatecture

Adding Akkatecture as a dependancy is like as installing any other NuGet package in your .net core application. All you need to do is the following:
```csharp
//Add the Akkatecture package to your project named MyFirstActorProject.
PM> Install-Package Akkatecture -ProjectName MyFirstActorProject
```
or
```csharp
dotnet add package Akkatecture
```
Once youve done that you can start designing your domain that can allow you to do something like what is shown below:

```csharp
//Create actor system
var system = ActorSystem.Create("useraccount-example");

//Create supervising aggregate manager for UserAccount aggregate root actors
var aggregateManager = system.ActorOf(Props.Create(() => new UserAccountAggregateManager()));

//Build create user account aggregate command with name "foo bar"
var aggregateId = UserAccountId.New;
var createUserAccountCommand = new CreateUserAccountCommand(aggregateId, "foo bar");
            
//Send command, this is equivalent to command.publish() in other cqrs frameworks
aggregateManager.Tell(createUserAccountCommand);
```

> This example is part of the Akkatecture simple example [project](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/examples/simple), checkout [the
code](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/blob/master/examples/simple/Akkatecture.Examples.UserAccount.Application/Program.cs#L13) and give it a run to see how it works.
