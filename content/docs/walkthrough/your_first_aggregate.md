On analysis of the business requirements, it is apparent that the main aggregate entity that exists under the `Bank` domain is a `BankAccount`. The bank account aggregate needs the ability to be `Created` and to `Send Money` to other `BankAccounts`. Inversely, `BankAccount`'s need to also `Receive Money`. Lets call our aggregate responsible for holding bank account state the `AccountAggregate`.

## The Account Aggregate

First we need to make an `Identity<>` for our aggregate.

```csharp
public class AccountId : Identity<AccountId>
{
    public AccountId(string value)
        : base(value)
    {
    }
}
```

Then we need to make the `Account` aggregate state model that will hold our balance:

```csharp
public class AccountState : AggregateState<Account, AccountId>
{
    public Money Balance { get; set; }
}
```

Lets make a simple `Money` ValueObject<decimal> that will represent money in our application, that must be non-negative.

```csharp
public class Money : SingleValueObject<decimal>
{
    public Money(decimal value)
        : base(value)
    {
        if(value < 0) throw new ArgumentException(nameof(value));
    }

    //overload the + and - operators to support the 
    //addition and subtraction of money
}
```

> Now we have a value object that represents money in our domain.

Now we can make our `Account` aggregate.

```csharp
public class Account : AggregateRoot<Account, AccountId, AccountState>
{
    public Account(AccountId aggregateId)
        : base(aggregateId)
    {
    }
}
```

And finally we need to make our aggregate root manager, which will be responsible for supervising, and creating the aggregate roots.

```csharp
public class AccountManager : AggregateManager<Account, AccountId, Command<Account, AccountId>> 
{
}
```

Now we need to interact with our aggregate through **commands**. Lets proceed to the next part of the walkthrough.
