Testing documentaion is still to be made. More comprehensive documentation on testing will be done in the near future. In the mean time you can have a look at the [Akkatecture.Tests](https://github.com/Lutando/Akkatecture/tree/master/test/Akkatecture.Tests) project on github to get an idea of how to test your domain. Feel free to suppliment that with petabridge's actor testing documentation using [akka.net TestKit](https://petabridge.com/blog/how-to-unit-test-akkadotnet-actors-akka-testkit/) to get a good idea about how to tests a project like this effectively.
